# WiFi-Password-Retriever
This is a tool which retrieves all saved Wi-Fi passwords from a device. The tool works without administrative privileges. The passwords that are retrieved are the passwords which were used by the device to last authenticate with the respective Access Point. This means that there are high chances that the password for an Access Point retrieved using this tool and the actual Access Point password may not be the same. The tool does not require an internet connection to work. Also, the tool currently runs only on Windows operating system.
